    "- Once we have the links, use requests to get content for each one. \n",
    "- Use beutiful soup to scrape the job description. \n",
    "- The idea is to give the user the choice of skills he wants the summary. For the initial process I will provide a list of skills and check the results to see if everything works clearly. Then move on to user inputs. \n",
    "- Once the code works for let's say 10 or 20 job searches, we can scale it to incorporate more companies.\n",
