A notebook on scraping.

# What to expect:
This notebook is to practice scraping skills. Now projects are much better when grounded in reality and objective. Since we have all been in the dreaded phase of job hunting, I am taking some inspiration from the misery. The end result of the scraping excercise will be to showcase which skills company are really looking for. How those results are portrayed are yet to be decided but initially I am leaning towards a percentage of how many times each skill was mentioned in job listings and a bar chart to visualise the count. 

I'll update the readme as the project gets more concrete and in the final form.
